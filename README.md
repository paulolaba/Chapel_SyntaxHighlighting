# Chapel: Syntax Highlighting (Sublime Text)
A simple (and useful) tutorial for inserting Chapel syntax highlighting into Sublime Text Editor (https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/linux_repositories.html).

To insert Chapel syntax highlighting into Sublime Text, the procedure is very easy and can be divided in two steps. The steps below apply to Linux, Mac and Windows.

### Step 1:

Go to Tools menu > Developer > New Syntax

### Step 2: 

Copy the contents of the file below:

[sublime_chapel_v1.2.txt](https://github.com/paulolaba/chapel/files/12706648/sublime_chapel_v1.2.txt)

Save your new syntax highlighting with the name "Chapel.sublime-syntax".

After these steps, the Chapel syntax highlighter will be available in the View menu > Syntax > Chapel

This is the first (basic) version. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
